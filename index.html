  <title>This webpage has a super long title, I don't think your browser can display it all, good luck trying. if you are using
        chrome, just hover your mouse cursor over the title tab, and you will see the complete title. However, if you don't
        already know this, I guess you couldn't see this hint. Unless you are reading the html file. But why would you look
        at my html file? get you self a chrome, set up a server, and read this in your browser! I guess not every body loves
        long title. What can you do about it? Nothing! Well, technically, you can just modify this html and make this title
        shorter. But why would you do that? You are a busy person. There are a lot of meaningful things to do in your life.
        Read a book, watch a movie, talk to your friends, have a party, have a life! Don't waste your time reading this title.
        Ohhhhh, you've already read it. Well, maybe next time you could do something a little bit smarter than this. Oh dear,
        you are so cute!</title>

    <h1>Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a PhD student at the University of Arizona. My advisor is Prof. Joshua A. Levine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I research mainly visualization and a little bit of machine learning. I am currently experimenting using some generative model to
      assist researchers visualize and analyze [time-varying/multivariate] volumetric data.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time, I might also be working on any topics relate to computing, algorithm, graphics, topology, cats, etc.
